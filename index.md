## ICIPE Hpc Environment
In general you can use the command module avail to show you the list of available software and their versions. Sometimes there are other software packages installed which aren't listed via the modules system; if you're curious you can look around in /export/apps to see if you can find what you're looking for.

Otherwise, here is a feeble attempt to list the software we have installed at ILRI, their versions, and (possibly) anyone who has experience running it. We endeavor to keep this list updated as the One True List™.
