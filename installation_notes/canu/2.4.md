### Canu
Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler designed for high-noise single-molecule sequencing (such as the PacBio RSII or Oxford Nanopore MinION).




## Information
Version: 2.4
Added: September, 2021
Link: http://canu.readthedocs.io/

## Usage 
See which versions of canu are available:
  ` $ module avail canu`

Load one version into your environment and run it:

```
$ module load canu/1.8
$ canu

```

Note: By default canu will try to use all the CPUs available on the machine so you should limit it to the number of CPUs requested in your SLURM jobs with the maxThreads option. See the documentation.
